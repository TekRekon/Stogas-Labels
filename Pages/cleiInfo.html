        <h1>What Are CLEI Codes?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>CLEI Codes are 10 character alpha numeric codes that have a 1:1 relationship to a product identifier (aka part number). Typically, the CLEI code identifies field replaceable units.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CLEI Codes may be used by telecom service providers for:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Inventory</li>
            <li>Ordering</li>
            <li>Repair</li>
            <li>Asset tracking</li>
            <li>Provisioning</li>
            <li>Maintainence</li>
            <li>Disaster Recovery</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>A Brief History</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You will find CLEI codes mostly on equipment sold to the largest carriers like AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, but there are other carriers worldwide that are using or are looking at using CLEI codes to identify their entire network infrastructure.  CLEI codes have been around for many generations and was used mainly by AT&T and the Bell Operating Companies.  But with all the mergers and acquisitions, many service providers are turning to CLEI codes to help with managing their network infrastructure and supply chain.</li>
            <li>CLEI codes started out in the TIRKS and PICS operating systems.  PICS(Plug In Control System) was designed to be used to control the inventory of Plug-Ins as in-service or as a spare for future growth.  The spare would be shipped to a warehouse were it would be stocked in a CLEI coded bin until needed.  Because the RBOC's could not fully populate a shelf in a Central Office without justifying it with large amounts of traffic, they would need to only put as many lines in service as needed.</li>
            <li>TIRKS (Trunk Integrated Record Keeping System) managed the provisioning aspect by inventorying all the spare slots and ports. As a circuit started to reach peak, another circuit would need to be deployed.  Technicians could use a Function code in TIRKS to provision a new circuit.  By entering the function code, "in a mechanized way" the system would send out orders to each of its modules, to either obtain a spare port or if there was none available, an order would be sent to a warehouse saying that location "A" needs a ABC line card with CLEI "X".  The person working in the warehouse would then box the item and it would be shipped out to location "A". Upon arrival, the technician could set the dip switches if applicable and plug the card into the slot, then make their final connections before they turn the circuit on.</li>
            <li>Nowadays, CLEI codes are used on many telecom products.  As the CLEI code evolves it is being put on more type of equipment. It started out as just a Central Office code and has managed to get into the Customer Premise Equipment and wireless equipment.  Interestingly, it is also starting to be used in other part of the world.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Asset Tracking</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In some cases, a service provider will not pay for equipment received if it does not have a CLEI Code label. Most Bell Operating Companies track their assets for depreciation and reporting what they spent on equipment. They use another code called a CPR (Continuing Property Record) in order to do this.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Is the CLEI Code So Important?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Let's say you are going into a grocery store to pickup some items.  As you go down the aisles you see all the products and each product is labeled with a barcode. The same holds true in the Telecom world.  Each Phone company needs to have a way to Inventory and stock the products that they purchase from a manufacturer.  But as you can see from reading above, the CLEI code does much more than help in inventory or asset tracking.  It also helps a Corporation communicate better by standardizing the way it identifies a product.</li>
            <li>An example, Let's say "Stogas Communications" (fictitious name) is a Common Language CLEI Code licensee.  Their customer base is growing and they need to expand their network. Since Stogas Communications requires the CLEI code label on all equipment they purchase, they know that they will need to order a SONET card with CLEI code STGSISN1AA.(OC1 card)</li>
            <li>A technician can be sent out to the field with the correct OC1 card (STGSISN1AA) that will give them the added bandwidth to support their customers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>So Why Not Use the Part Number?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>So you are probably thinking, why not use the part number?  Easily explained, Service Provider, Stogas Communications buys equipment from more than one customers and even within each manufacturer there are different part number structures and Ordering codes, Marketing numbers Etc stamped on the equipment, added to the website.  In a perfect world in might just work if every employee of Stogas Communications thought the same way and added each part to the database the same way.  But, since that is not the case, our workers are not sure of what number to put in the field?  </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>So What Happens When CLEI Codes Are Not Used?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Service Provider, Stogas Communications is not a CLEI code Licensee and uses part numbers as identifiers.  The new expansion card has Model ABC-D and part number 123 rev A.  So Stogas Communications requires its employees to only put the part number into its nationwide database.  John in warehouse A receives 1000 new expansion cards.  In Warehouse B, Larry receives 10 new expansion cards.  The items are exact but here is were the confusion sets in.  John enters the part number as 123revA, Larry enters 123-rev-A.  When Larry sees that his inventory has dropped to the level of 5 expansion cards left, he will need to reorder to replenish back up to the level of 10.  But before he makes his order he decides to check the Stogas nationwide database in case there are surplus somewhere else.  He enters in the search field 123-rev-a and the search comes back negative, so he goes and orders more expansion cards. If he had entered in 123revA he would of seen John had a full inventory of that card in his warehouse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Benefits of CLEI Codes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>So you can see Stogas Communications starts losing money because there is no consistency of identifying products. If you are the manufacturer and are putting CLEI codes onto your equipment, your customer will be able to stock and order using the CLEI code.  Once its in the OSS, the Service Provider will be coming back to you for more product asking for the exact product using the designated CLEI code. </li>
            <li>#2, if you are revising the product that your customer had purchased and are adding more enhancements or new feature upgrades, you can get a PCN(Product Change Notice) CLEI code to identify the new release.  Once you get the PCN, you can blast out the PCN to all your customers that have received the older product, sort of like a special advertisement, if the Service Provider needs that upgrade they know where to go.</li>
            <li>Your product is also added into the registry and that registry is downloaded to all the Service Providers using CLEI to identify equipment. </li>
        </ul>
