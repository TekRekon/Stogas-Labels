<h1>FAQ</h1>
<ul>
    <li>What are CLEI labels?
        <ul>
            <li>Visit <a href="cleiInfo.html">this</a> page to learn more!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>I can't use your service because my serial numbers are printed on demand.
        <ul>
            <li>Try to obtain a list of serial numbers that were printed post-production. If you are able to obtain a list of serial numbers, you can give us the listing along with their respective CLEI codes.  Most orders are completed within 3 working days, some may be a little longer. If your products are sitting in a staging area you may be able to order the CLEI code labels and have them shipped to the location where the products will be installed. The labels we print will have the serial number printed so that they will be easier to match to the correct product.</li>
